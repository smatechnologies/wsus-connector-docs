# Enterprise Manager Job Definition

The WSUS Connector includes a job sub-type to assist with the definition of WSUS jobs. When defining a job in the Enterprise Manager or the Job Type steps, make sure you:

1. Select Windows in the Job Type drop-down list.
2. Select WSUS in the Job Sub-Type drop-down list.

For more information, refer to Adding Jobs in the Enterprise Manager documentation. 

### WSUS Sub-Type

WSUS sub-type simplifies the job definition process by displaying fields to generate the command line for different supported WSUS commands.

### Job Details Tab

The fields include:

* **User ID**
    * Defines the User ID assigned to the job for Windows security authentication.
    * Define "UseServiceAccount" if the MSLSAM is running as a Domain User. For additional information on running the MSLSAM as a Domain User, refer to [Service Configuration Options](https://help.smatechnologies.com/opcon/agents/windows/administration/service-configuration) in the Microsoft LSAM documentation.
    * Define a specific Domain User if the MSLSAM is running as the Local System. For additional information on running the MSLSAM as the Local System, refer to [Service Configuration Options](https://help.smatechnologies.com/opcon/agents/windows/administration/service-configuration) in the Microsoft LSAM documentation.
    * If the User ID does not list the Domain User, register the Domain User in the Enterprise Manager.
* **ConnectorPath**
    * Defines the location of the server component that will beexecuted through the OpCon job.
* **Server Name**: 
    * Defines the server on which the updates are to be checked and/or installed.The example in the WSUS Job Definition Screen figure is using a Job Instance (JI) property.
* **Application Path**
    * Defines the path to the Client component, either on the local target server or, as in the WSUS Job Definition Screen figure, a shared UNC network path.
* **Retrieve Update List**
    * *(Optional)* Tells the connector to retrieve a list of updates that are available for the server No updates are installed. If this option is not selected, then any applicable updates are downloaded and installed.
* **Include List**
    * *(Optional)* Tells the connector to install only the updates in this file on the server.
* **ExcludeList**
    * *(Optional)* Tells the connector to installall updates for this server, except any found in the Exclude list.

The **WSUS Job Definition Screen** figure above shows the recommended way of configuring the WSUS job: a Multi-Instance job with Server Name as an instance property. This allows a single OpCon job definition to be used for any number of target servers.

### Failure Criteria Tab

The Failure Criteria tab defines the information to determine if the query was successful.

* **ExitCodes**
    * ProvidesfieldstodefinebasiccriteriaforOpContodeterminethefinalstatusofthejob. By default, all return codes not equal to 0 are considered as Failed. If any one of the criteria is TRUE at the end of a job, the OpCon reports the job as Failed. Up to five different failure criteria may be defined. A failure criterion contains two parts: Operator and Exit Code Integer:

* **Operator**
    * An exit code criterion may use one of the following operators to compare the exit code with a user-defined value.
        * **EQ** (equal to)
        * **NE** (not equal to)
        * **LT** (less than)
        * **GT** (greatert han)
        * **GE** (greater than or equal to) 
        * **LE** (less than or equal to)
* **ExitCodeInteger**
    * Any integer( -2, 147, 483, 648 through 2, 147, 483, 647) to compare with the job's exit code.

### Job Instance Definition

The **Job Instance Definition** figure below the Instance definitions for ServerName. In this case, the job is being used for five SQL Servers.

When the schedule containing this WSUS job is built, a separate job for each instance is built. Each of these jobs process independently and report back the results of the update on that Server.

![](../static/img/built_jobs.png)

The results of the update process for each server will be reflected in a WSUS exit code. A complete list of exit codes can be found in the [WSUS Connector Messages](reference-information#wsus-connector-messages) section of this documentation. OpCon events can be defined for the different exit codes so that notification, escalation, and follow-up actions can be carried out if required. The output from the connector for each job can be viewed by right-clicking on a job and selecting **View Job Output** from the menu. A suggested strategy might be to have a separate WSUS job for each Server type or QA Servers and so forth.
